# Tracking for Visualisation

Some important accelerator ideas can be difficult to explain to a brand-new audience
- How does a single particle move around in phase space?
- What is tune?
- How does a phase space evolve during beam transport?

I threw together this code to make some simple visualisations - often animations, but sometimes static images - to aide in answering these questions.

(Yes, I know there are many improvements that could be made, but please be aware that most of this was developed ad-hoc with no plans to share at the time!)

Thanks, and happy visualising!
